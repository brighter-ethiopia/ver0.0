We work with our in-country financial partners to add loans for water and sanitation solutions to their portfolios. These partners then mobilize funding from capital markets to provide affordable loans to people in need of water. People living in poverty use these loans to put a tap or toilet in their homes. Every repaid loan creates the opportunity for another family to get the safe water and toilets they need, fast and affordably. It is a pay-it-forward system that makes it possible to help more people in ways that will last.</p>
